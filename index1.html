        <h1>Smart City Traffic Management System</h1>
    
        <p>Urbanization and the rapid increase in vehicular traffic have made traffic management one of the most critical challenges for modern cities. Traditional traffic control systems, which rely on fixed timers and manual monitoring, are often inefficient and unable to adapt to the dynamic nature of urban traffic. This inefficiency leads to increased congestion, longer travel times, higher fuel consumption, and elevated levels of air pollution. As cities continue to grow, there is an urgent need for smarter, more adaptive, and scalable solutions to manage traffic effectively.</p>
    
        <h2>Overview of the Smart City Traffic Management System</h2>
        <p>The Smart City Traffic Management System is an innovative solution that leverages deep learning and computer vision to address these challenges. By utilizing advanced object detection techniques, this system can monitor and analyze traffic in real-time, enabling smarter decision-making for traffic control. The project employs the YOLOv8 model by Ultralytics, a state-of-the-art deep learning framework known for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks. The system is designed to detect and classify various types of vehicles, including cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and pedestrians, with high precision.</p>
    
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use of Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)</strong>: This allows the model to detect objects at various angles, which is particularly useful in traffic scenarios where vehicles may appear in different orientations due to camera placement or road geometry.</li>
            <li><strong>Dataset and Annotation</strong>: The dataset for this project was collected from Roboflow, a platform that provides high-quality annotated datasets for machine learning applications. The data was annotated using the CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool), ensuring accurate labeling for training the model.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>The implementation of this system involves the integration of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PyTorch</strong> for model training.</li>
            <li><strong>OpenCV</strong> for real-time video processing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The trained model achieved an accuracy of 93%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world traffic scenarios. By providing real-time insights into traffic conditions, this system can help reduce congestion, improve road safety, and contribute to the development of smart city infrastructure.</p>
    
        <h2>Impact and Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>This project not only showcases the potential of deep learning in traffic management but also lays the foundation for future advancements in smart city technologies. With its high accuracy, scalability, and real-time processing capabilities, the Smart City Traffic Management System represents a significant step toward creating more efficient and sustainable urban environments.</p>
